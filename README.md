# Another Authenticator
A two-factor authentication app built with Flutter.

This app is currently being worked on, with hopes of publishing it one day...\
I don't consider it to be ready for production yet.\
There will likely be bugs and upgrade issues.

## Development
`flutter run`

## Features
- Scan QR or manually input account details
- Supports both Material (Android) and Cupertino (iOS) themes

## Proposed
- View secrets
- Backup secrets to cloud storage
- UI tests

## Licenses
MIT unless otherwise specified.\
